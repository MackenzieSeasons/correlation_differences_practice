# Question 1

The rating-compliant correlation is significantly stronger than the rating-critical correlation, delta *r* = .67, 95% *CI* [.32, 1.0], *p* = .0001

# Question 2

The rating-complaint correlation is stronger than the raises-critical correlation, delta *r* = .45, 95% *CI* [.14, .81], *p* = .005

# Question 3

The PI for our new study with *n* = 100 is 95% *PI*[.05, .74]. If the replication correlation falls outside this range, it is likely that the difference is due to factors other than sampling error.

# Question 4

Not entirely sure why you can't get a PI smaller than .5, but it would appear that you cannot. Perhaps it has something to do with the CI being large? **ask David on Tuesday**

# Question 5

The two correlations are not significantly different, delta *r* = .33, 95% *CI*[-.02, .59], *p* = .06

# Question 6

See above.
